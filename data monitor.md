We make some change on the architecture of our project，we mainly seperate the main process of the platform and the technology we use. what's more, we add some services to monitor the other services and quality of data collected by the service.  

from the picture，we can see that Three services are used to collect the data. First, this service will collect the real-time position message  from the smart phone installed in the bus .The message will be put into the message queue.THe schedule service will get the information from the message queue and make some decision based on some the schedule.we want to use some machine learing [	algorithm to make schedule; The Second  service will be used to collect the plan information of the service.finally,the third service will collect some routine message from the Baidu Map API. All the data will be sent to the database. We will make some elastic rules on two services. One Service will be used to monitor the quality of service and do some data verification as well. We may use some machine learning algorithms to predict the data when some data missing. The Other service will be used to monitor the healthcondition of all the other service and do some operation after some services fail to start.
