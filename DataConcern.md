# Data concern
## Types of data needed to collect
- The real time message of Bus position
- The routine of the Bus
- The schedule information of Bus

## source of data
- The smartphone's GPS 
- BaiDu Map API
- The Bus Company


## Quality of data 
- The Bus position data should be precise which must collect the latitude and longitude
- THe Bus position data also should be real-time which needed to ne sent at least every 30 seconds
- The latest routine and schedule should be complete

## Data Usage
- The use of Baidu Map API could be free with the permission of Baidu Inc. We intend to use the data of Baidu Map directly when develop.

## Quality of Service
- The network interface returns quickly (the server has a positioning response time of less than 50 milliseconds per time), and the average accuracy is 70 meters, of which the Wi-Fi accuracy is about 40 meters, the base station positioning accuracy is about 200 meters, and the coverage rate is 98%.

-80 thousand billion times request 
- 1300 thousand developers use 
- 650 thousand active applications 


## Context 
- The location URL of the routine is [link](http://lbsyun.baidu.com/)
